#### Solution

The code basically utilize K-Means clustering algorithm where $k=3$. To simplify the code, I directly apply the ready-to-use K-means function in machine learning library *scikit-learn*.

At the beginning of the program, the dataset which is stored in a text file is load into the memory and store in a 2-D array structure, *data_list*. It's a list of lists, in which every list contains two elements indicating **triglyceride** and **total cholesterol** indexes respectively. Then, the K-Means object is initialized and then fit the dataset. *Centers* indicates the three cluster centers after fitting. Then, *scatter* is used for drawing the diagram to illustrate the result of 3-Means.

The screenshot shows the diagram:
